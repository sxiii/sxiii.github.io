I can't say I'm too proud of the computer games I created, but if we talk about tabletop games - here you are! Together with my Rostov mates we developed a conspiracy game and now we are searching for a market for this game.

As a network security specialist and can help in a variety of situations such as performing a local/wireless network security audit, searching for important data or lost passwords, regaining access, etc. I can perform a forensics/security test of your 
web/application to ensure that it hasn't serious security issues.

    We did supplied a smart home and matrix screen solutions in my home market (Rostov-on-Don).
  description: | 
Speaking about smart homes and built-in devices, I worked with automation and ARM electronics such as Raspberry/Arduino/OrangePi in case for different projects such as 3D printing or drones. Worked a lot also with
access control with RFID/NFC, Raspberry Pi, Bluetooth, OBDII, wifi and X11 stacks. If you need affordable matrix screen for your office or home - that can be easily done! And the most important - I know how to combine all systems together in solid solution.

- name: Crowdfunding (fiat & crypto)
  link: TBD
  quote: >
    While I worked with local startupers, we launched several crowdfunding campaigns.
  description: | 
As a supporter, I funded 10+ projects on different platforms and started my own projects, too. I also build a small wikipedia about crowdfunding.

I've participated in new operating system projects and took part in more than 10 opensource operating systems, 
alongside with about 100 of opensource programs.

Also I worked alot with payments system, including not casual ones like bitcoins and altcoins (and classic, like yandex.money, webmoney, paypal, okpay, and more than 50+). I've owned a small hand-build mining farm, helped 
building a farm for 1000 GPUs as a main architect; traded bitcoins, written my own bitcoin trading robot. Used 
many mining pools and online altcoin exchanges, trading agencies. I've also made some publications about it, 
and made several presentations on different forums.

With my team of coders, we helped run multiple ICOs and wrote some of the cryptocurrency-related web platforms.

Important to mention that I am also expert in system analysis and software/internet researches. I have several 
publications and researches on different topics. I've developed own methodologies to perform different kinds of research.

Also I am working with multiple (mostly these can be called 'offline') projects, featuring ecology as the most important option: we develop electric cars and smart homes solutions. Speaking about electric cars, we are working towards selling EVs, converting gasoline cars to EVs, and also selling parts and servicing electric cars, providing electric cars with onboard clever PC with navigation, safety features etc. Speaking about smart homes, I developed complex solutions to provide customers with eco-house with zero-emission, clever ventilation, lighting and electricity system, and much more. 

I am manager of a MYEV and METANETWORK workgroups which are in charge of all of these projects. Some other projects include webservices for navigation (maps), improving user experience, helping users to understand programming, computer stuff and opensource software. Also, we are with my teams developing several linux distributions: one for embedding into electric cars, another one for web terminals/jukeboxes/gameboxes, and another one for desktops and laptops (mainstream users).

I have many solutions in different situations that can be used as a templates - that is why I am working fast and efficient. Photocameras (Canon, Minolta etc.) are my another tool - I make a lot of photos and videos with them since approximately year 2005. I worked as a event photographer in woman's magazine for many years and have a lot of experience in batch photo editing with opensource tools like imagemagick, darktable, etc.

Sometimes I take my time to give presentations, take part in different innovations forums (like Seliger), make open seminars, courses, webinars etc. I've translated several english-only courses to Russian and presented it by myself (for example, a 6 week-length course from IDEO and +Acumen called "Human-Centered Design Methodology" (HCD)). I am taking part in education life of southern part of Russia, being also a member of TED community here. I am in-touch with regional Linux user group (LUG), Alt Linux team, IT61 rostov regional IT community, FabLab community and others. As for forums, I've participated both as a speaker and as visitor on more than 100 Russian and international forums, including ones about technology, multimedia, news, modern cities, society and innovations, and more - across whole Russia including very long distance spots.

For all mentioned tasks I use free and opensource software. I can summarize myself as open hardware and open software geek/addict/software freedom activist. I am also voting for privacy, constitution, freedom of the word and thought, and I am member of Pirate Party in Russia and worldwide. I believe in future resource-based balanced communism without religions, money and wars.
