    We did supplied a smart home and matrix screen solutions in my home market (Rostov-on-Don); developed a drone
  description: | 
    Speaking about smart homes and built-in devices, I worked with automation and ARM electronics such as 
    [Raspberry/Arduino/OrangePi](https://bit.ly/hwmeetup) in case for different projects such as 3D printing or [drones](https://bit.ly/droneproduction). I've build
    a large octocopter that can handle 8 kilograms and performs as professional aerial photography 
    drone for less than 500$. I also worked a lot also with access control with RFID/NFC, Raspberry Pi, 
    Bluetooth, OBDII, wifi and X11 stacks. If you need [affordable matrix screen](https://bit.ly/metawall) for your office or home -
    easily done! And the most important - I know how to combine all systems together in solid solution.
    As for smart home soultions, look at the "ECOLOGY" section. Our work is published online by me and the team.
    Also, we developed a turn-key solutions for small data-centers like cryptocurrency mining farms. There we
    managed to develop an effictive HVAC system along with power distrubution, packaging, security, remote control etc.

    I've owned a small hand-build [mining farm](https://bit.ly/miningexp), helped building a farm for 1000 GPUs as an architect; traded bitcoins, 
    written my own bitcoin trading robots. Used [mining pools](https://bit.ly/cryptominingpools) and online altcoin exchanges. I've also made some 
    publications on that, and made several presentations on different forums. With my team of coders, we helped run 
    several ICOs and wrote some of the [cryptocurrency-related web platforms](https://bit.ly/cryptolinks). Also I've managed to gather & categorize links to [more than 1000 of crytocurrency-related projects](https://bit.ly/cryptolist) and published them on online wiki "metalist.space".
    As stated in the "HARDWARE" section, we developed three mining farms, one of which is handling more than 1000 GPUs total.
    In my local city, I've managed to gather people and created a [META DAO](https://bit.ly/metadao), which was acting as [cryptostartup accelerator](https://fbit.ly/cryptoaccel).

    Also I am working with multiple (mostly these can be called 'offline') projects, featuring ecology 
    as the most important option: [we develop electric cars](https://bit.ly/myevru) and [smart homes solutions](https://bit.ly/metahome). Speaking about electric 
    cars, we are working towards selling EVs, converting gasoline cars to EVs, and also selling parts and 
    servicing electric cars, providing electric cars with onboard clever PC with navigation, safety features etc. 
    Speaking about smart homes, I developed complex solutions to provide customers with eco-house with zero-emission, 
    clever ventilation, lighting and electricity system, and much more. Smart home solutions also included solar
    panels and solar collector controlling systems. 
    For all mentioned tasks I use free and opensource software. I can summarize myself as open
